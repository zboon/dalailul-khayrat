/* Offline support: caches the app shell and fonts on first visit.

   there is a connection, and falls back to the cache when there isn't. The
   old worker was cache-first for everything, which meant the ONLY way to
   ever see an update was for this file itself to change — so a deploy that
   missed sw.js froze the app permanently with no way out from the phone.
   Everything else (fonts, icons, manifest) stays cache-first: it's large,
   it doesn't change, and it's what makes the app work with no signal. */

   This matters more than it looks. The cleanup deletes every cache whose name
   is not the current one — which is right for the app shell, and was quietly
   fatal for audio: a listener downloads all seven portions over the masjid
   wifi, a typo fix ships, and 150MB disappears on next launch with nothing
   said. Audio is expensive to fetch and must outlive app versions, so its
   cache name carries no version and is never swept.
